Analysis	Apply analytical methods to existing data of a specific type.	EDAM	operation_2945	ST	Analysis		multi-select	{url=http://edamontology.org/operation_2945}		
Analysis identifier	An assay identifier is an identifier that identifies some assay (analysis).	AFR	0001979	ST	Analysis identifier		text	{url=http://purl.allotrope.org/ontologies/result#AFR_0001979}	Analysis

Physical data location	A reference to a place on the Earth, by its name or by its geographical location. This definition is intentionally vague to allow reuse locally (e.g. which computer), for contacting (e.g. which institute), broadly for logistical or legal reasons (e.g. city, country or continent).

Algorithms used	A defined procedure for solving a problem. Applied to a problem-solving procedure implemented in software to be executed by a computer.	NCIT	C16275	ST	Algorithms used		text	{url=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C16275}	Analysis	
Bioinformatic protocol used	A human-readable collection of information about about how a scientific experiment or analysis was carried out that results in a specific set of data or results used for further analysis or to test a specific hypothesis.	EDAM	data_2531	ST	Bioinformatic protocol used		text	{url=http://edamontology.org/data_2531}	Analysis	
Bioinformatic protocol deviation	A variation from processes or procedures defined in the bioinformatic protocol. Deviations usually do not preclude the overall evaluability of subject data for either efficacy or safety, and are often acknowledged and accepted in advance by the sponsor.

Reason for bioinformatic protocol deviation	The rationale for why a deviation from the bioinformatic protocol has occurred.	NCIT	C93529	ST	Reason for bioinformatic protocol deviation		text	{url=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C93529}	Analysis	
WGS guideline followed	Any followed systematic statement of policy rules or principles. Guidelines may be developed by government agencies at any level, institutions, professional societies, governing boards, or by convening expert panels.
